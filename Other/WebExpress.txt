URL redirects, for example going from https://www.colorado.edu/learncheme/some-webpage.html to http://www.learncheme.com/some-other-webpage.html, are handled by CU Boulder's "WebExpress" team. We need to put in a request on this website:

https://www.colorado.edu/webcentral/content/website-request

We will explain what needs to be done, and give a list of all the URL redirects.
